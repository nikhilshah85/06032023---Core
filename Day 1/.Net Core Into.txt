--------------------------------------------------------------------
		.Net Core
	
1. This is a complete re-write of .net framework 
2. .Net framework was a very costly framework (the only 1 in industry)
	For development lets say with 50 developers

		50 Windows OS - Buy the licence - pay the cost
		50 Visual Studio - Buy the licence - pay the cost
		Host the app - Buy windows server - pay the cost 


	where as - we this days have 
		Angular, Node, React, backBone, knockOut - all this are free and cross platform 
		They also have a huge and strong features which are needed today - against drawbacks in .net framework
		This allowed free development
	
		Cloud has comeup - huge and beautiful services 
			cloud is mosly unix-linux based, .net framework does fit here

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Thus Microsoft gave us a framework - very rich in terms of features, open source, standards etc...
				Which is 
				Cross-Platform 
				Free to use
				.Net core - very rich and mostly based on Design patterns
				.Net Core CLI - Command line interface - develop, build, test, run, host app using command line
				VS Code - New IDE - free - like Visual Studio
