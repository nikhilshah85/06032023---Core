1. We will have to write data validations on a view page - use Jquery - javascript

	Problem
	1. you will have to write and attach on every page which this model proper is used
	2. What if Javascript is disabled on client browser / machine

Thus we will also have to write server side code, which is a double work
	
Make sure error messages in both the code are same

----------------------------------------
also the display of Model properties are not acceptable or presentable

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Thus we now use DataAnnotations from System.ComponentModel and apply attributes, which will take care of

		a. Client Side Validation
		b. Server Side Validation
		c. Display Formats 
	all of this done 1ce and centrally in the model file
