						CORS 



 A very Important feature for .net core - CORS

Task 1 : Create a new WebAPI - shoppingAPI -  application useing EF Core to read data from SQL Server - shoppingDB
	This will have 2 table - Products - Customers
	Make sure all the CRUD operations are working from API

	We now need to share URL's with customers to consume the API 


Task 2: Create a new MVC Application - shippingMVC 
	Make calls to above api to display products on a view page



	USE fetch api or HttpClint as per your convienent 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	There will be a problem in the end - and we will fix it useing CORS

				
				1. try - add a new view - add textbox and button, enter pid and display details
				2. try to post the data as well - logical - not difficult
